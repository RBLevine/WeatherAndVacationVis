A Python script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world with varying distance from the equator. Scatter plots are used to visualize the Temperature (F), Humidity (%), Cloudiness (%), and Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude. Linear Regression is also used to further analyze Temp, Humidity, Cloudiness, and Wind Speed in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. From here, a heat map is used to display the humidity of each of those 500+ cities in order to help narrow down possible vacation spots that fit user ideal conditions.
The Web Page with analysis is published [HERE]().
The Weather and Vacation folders both contain .ipnyb files that are Jupyter Notebooks that show data ETL prior to the creation of the web page.
